# sudoku-frontend
Frontend to talk to a sudoku solver API

## TODO

- ~~Better tagging of docker images i.e. no hard-coding~~
- ~~Push to a docker repository. Use that pipeline instead of doing `docker save` here and `docker load` at the infra-as-code codebase~~
- Deprecate makefile calls to save+zip docker image
- 
- Write proper Readme
